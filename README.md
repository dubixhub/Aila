# Aila
AILA is a personal security application designed to help users stay safe when meeting people or entering unfamiliar environments. Users can add trusted emergency contacts (phone numbers &amp; email), set a countdown timer, and—if the alert is not cancelled before time runs out—an automatic emergency notification will be sent to selected contacts.
